# FTController - Software
In this folder you can find the software for the FTController:
It can be opened with the Arduino IDE or Visual Studio with the VisualMicro Extension.

Use "Arduino Pro Or Pro Mini" Board with ATMega328 CPU and 16MHz as target and it should work fine with the FTController PCB. The FTController does not have an Serial port, so you will need an ISP Programmer (like the USBasp) to flash the Sketch.
